# Functional Requirements

The functional requirements, detailed in the thought process, are organized into several key areas to ensure comprehensive coverage:

### GitHub Integration

* The software supports **GitHub OAuth** for **user authentication**, allowing users to sign in and grant access to their repositories.
* It lists the **user’s GitHub repositories** and **allows selection**, with the **option to choose a branch** (**defaulting to main**).
* It set up **GitHub Webhooks** to **receive notifications on pushes**, enabling **automated triggers** for the DevOps pipeline.

### Repository Analysis

* The software analyzes the repository to identify the **programming language** and **framework**. Alternatively, users can select their preferred language and framework through the **user interface**, featuring popular options such as Node.js, Python, and Java or FastAPI, Flask, and NodeJS.
* It should identify **build tools** and **configuration files** (e.g., **package.json**, **requirements.txt**, **pom.xml**) to determine the appropriate build process.

### Build Process

* Based on the detected language and framework, the software will **define and execute** build steps for **Pre-configured pipelines** such as **`running npm install`** and **`npm run build`** for **Node.js** or **`pip install -r requirements.txt`** for **Python**.
* The build process prepares the application for deployment, ensuring it is compiled and ready for the cloud.

### Cloud Deployment

* The software will support deployment to a specified cloud provider, with the thought process suggesting **AWS** as the **initial choice for simplicity**.
* It will provision the necessary **cloud resources**, such as **compute instances** or **databases**, and deploy the built application, potentially using services like AWS **EC2**, **S3**, and so on.
* The thought process considers using **containers** (e.g., **Docker**) and **orchestration** (e.g., **Kubernetes**), **but for the MVP**, a simpler approach like **EC2 free tiers**.

### DevOps Pipeline

* The software will set up an **automated preconfigured CI/CD pipeline** that **triggers** on **GitHub pushes**, including **build** and **deploy** stages.
* The software will **containerize** **the application** and **upload the image** to the **AWS ECR Registry.**
* The software will streamline the **cloud infrastructure** by using **Terraform scripts.**

### User Interface

* A web-based UI will be provided for **user interaction**, allowing users to **connect their GitHub** **account**, **select repositories**, **configure deployments**, and **monitor status**.
* The interface should be intuitive, requiring minimal input such as the **application name**, **language**, **framework**, **database** (**optional**), and **environment variables**.

### Security

* The software will securely handle **GitHub credentials** and **cloud provider** **credentials**, ensuring user data and application code are protected.
* The thought process emphasizes that **the software manages its own cloud account**, **using IAM roles for isolation**, **avoiding the need for users to interact directly with the cloud**.

* * *

# Non-Functional Requirements

The non-functional requirements, as outlined in the thought process, ensure the software meets quality standards beyond functionality:

### Performance

The deployment process should be efficient, completed within a reasonable time frame, and handle multiple concurrent deployments.

### Scalability

The system must be scalable to handle a large number of users and deployments, potentially using a multi-tenant architecture within a single cloud account for the MVP.

### **Availability**

The system should be highly available to ensure continuous operation, supporting developers’ needs at any time.

### Security

Adhere to security best practices, including proper authentication, authorization, and encryption of sensitive data.

### Reliability

The platform should ensure reliable operations by implementing robust error-handling and recovery mechanisms. It should provide consistent performance and maintain uptime even during peak usage periods.

### Maintainability

The software should be designed with modularity and clean code practices to facilitate easy updates and maintenance. Documentation should be comprehensive to support future development and troubleshooting.

### Usability

The user interface should be intuitive and accessible, providing clear navigation and guidance throughout the deployment process. User feedback should be incorporated to continuously improve the user experience.

### Compliance

Ensure that the platform adheres to relevant industry standards and regulations, such as GDPR for data protection and privacy, to build trust with users and maintain legal compliance.

# **MVP Scope and Constraints**

The MVP scope, as defined in the thought process, focuses on delivering core functionality to validate the concept:

* **Support for one cloud provider** (e.g., **AWS**).
* The user **must have a GitHub account**.
* Support for **Node.js** and **Python** applications, given their popularity and ease of detection.
* Basic build and deployment functionality utilizing services such as **AWS EC2 free tiers** and **S3** for simplicity.
* **Simple monitoring and logging**, ensuring users can track deployment status.
* **GitHub integration with OAuth and Webhooks**, providing a seamless user experience.
* A **basic web UI for interaction**, keeping the interface minimal and user-friendly.

* * *

# Constraints and assumptions

* Users **must have a GitHub account** and a **repository with valid cod**e.
* **The software manages its own cloud account**, ensuring users **avoid direct interaction with the cloud**, using **IAM roles and resource tagging for isolation.**
* The application code in the repository is **compatible with the supported languages and frameworks**, simplifying the initial scope.
* **The MVP will not include advanced features** such as multi-cloud support or complex orchestration tools like Kubernetes, focusing instead on delivering a streamlined and functional deployment experience.
* **Resource limitations** may affect the scalability and performance of the MVP, requiring prioritization of essential features to ensure a viable product launch.
* **User feedback** will be crucial in refining the platform and expanding its capabilities post-MVP, guiding the development of additional features and improvements.
* **Initial deployment targets** will be limited to simple web applications, with plans to extend support to more complex architectures in future iterations.
